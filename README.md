# Develop a python screener which will be run daily to check primarily pre-market small and midcap stock data for quality tickers which are then selected for daytrading separately. We are looking for gapping price in premarket, relative higher volume compared to previous periods and liquidity which makes a ticket perfect for daytrading every ticker we check.
# The code should be production reader, well structured and ready to be extended in the future - overall a code base which is at senior level of python coders who is also an excellent profitable daytrader and knows what makes a screener perfect for ticker selection for every day market opening.
